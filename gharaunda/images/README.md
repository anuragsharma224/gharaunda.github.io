## Image Optimization Tips

1. **Compress your images** - Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh
2. **Use appropriate formats** - JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
3. **Optimize file size** - Keep images under 200KB when possible
4. **Maintain aspect ratios** - Follow the recommended dimensions above
5. **Use descriptive filenames** - Makes it easier to manage

## Placeholder Images

Until you add your own images, the website uses placeholder images from placeholder services. These will automatically be replaced when you upload your actual images with the correct filenames.
